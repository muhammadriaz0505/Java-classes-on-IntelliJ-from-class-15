What is polyMorphism:
 polyMorphism is the ability of a method to behave differently depending upon the object or parameters that we pass
 to a method.
 When we pass different parameters to a method and it behaves differently then it is called.
 static PolyMorphism or compile time PolyMorphism or early binding.
 when we achieve PolyMorphism trough method overriding then it is called dynamic binding or run time PolyMorphism or
 late binding.
 Why we should use PolyMorphism:
 1) Cleaner code.
 2) We never prefer to change the existing code if we want to improve something we always want to create new methods
 and new classes .we can call these methods using the parent classes variable/reference.
 3)we can call multiple methods from many classes with the help of a single variable.Like we can create the array of
   objects and with the help of a loop will abe a ble to call all the methods from all the classes
   How cam we  PolyMorphism:
   1)Create a parent child relationship.
   2) Override the methods in the child classes.
   3) Create the array of all the Child classs objects and with the help of loop you can call all the methods from all
     the methods from all the child classes.
     Rules:
      1. All the rules that apply for overriding also apply for the polymorphism.
        2.We can store the object of the child class inside a variable of type parent class.
          But we cannot do the reverse.
        3.We can also create arrays of type parent and they can hold object of child class.
